# Aligning the contract

## Current

The current model for the contract in Prometheus-X works as a centralized service entity which manages:

- P2P contract generation
- Ecosystem contract generation
- ODRL policy injection
- Contract signature

## Goal

To expand reach and compatibility with more projects and partners, it will be needed to have a deeper alignment in how this aligns with IDSA's contract negotiation protocol.

This push towards alignment will get us closer to

- Having a fully IDSA compliant building block for contract
- Having compatibility with EDC connectors
- Having PTX components included in more projects

## Requirements for IDSA

There are 2 different elements to think about in regards to alignment with IDSA Contract Protocol

- [Adapting an implementation for PTX](./mediator-protocol.md)
- [Integrating the IDS Negotiation Protocol in the PDC](./contract-connector-requirements.md)
